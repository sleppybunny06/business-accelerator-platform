# ðŸš¨ URGENT VERCEL FIX - "react-scripts: command not found"

## The Problem
Vercel is still running the build from the root directory instead of the `client` directory.

## The Solution - UPDATE VERCEL DASHBOARD SETTINGS

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard
1. Open your Vercel project dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **General**

### Step 2: Configure These Settings EXACTLY
- **Root Directory**: `client` (NOT empty, NOT `./client`)
- **Framework Preset**: `Create React App`
- **Build Command**: Leave empty (let Vercel auto-detect)
- **Output Directory**: Leave empty (let Vercel auto-detect)
- **Install Command**: Leave empty (let Vercel auto-detect)

### Step 3: Save and Redeploy
1. Click **"Save"**
2. Go to **Deployments** tab
3. Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment

## Why This Happens
When Root Directory is not set correctly, Vercel tries to build from the project root where `react-scripts` is not installed.

## Expected Result After Fix
```
âœ… Installing dependencies from client/package.json
âœ… Running react-scripts build from client directory
âœ… Building React app successfully
âœ… Deployment succeeds
```

## If It Still Fails
Double-check that:
1. Root Directory shows `client` in your settings (not empty)
2. You clicked "Save" after changing settings
3. You redeployed after saving settings

The build should work immediately after updating these dashboard settings.
